-- Question 1
-- Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
-- Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

-- In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

-- tweets Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- tweet_id	integer
-- user_id	integer
-- msg	string
-- tweet_date	timestamp
-- tweets Example Input:
-- tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
-- 214252	111	Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
-- 739252	111	Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
-- 846402	111	Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
-- 241425	254	If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
-- 231574	148	I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00
-- Example Output:
-- tweet_bucket	users_num
-- 1	2
-- 2	1
-- Explanation:
-- Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. 
-- The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.

select tweet_bucket, count(*) as users_num 
FROM 
    (SELECT user_id, count(*) as tweet_bucket FROM tweets 
    where tweet_date Between '01/01/2022'  and '12/31/2022'
    group by user_id) as a 
group by tweet_bucket order by 1 ;



-- Question 2
-- Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. 
-- You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

-- Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

-- Assumption:

-- There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
-- candidates Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- candidate_id	integer
-- skill	varchar
-- candidates Example Input:
-- candidate_id	skill
-- 123	Python
-- 123	Tableau
-- 123	PostgreSQL
-- 234	R
-- 234	PowerBI
-- 234	SQL Server
-- 345	Python
-- 345	Tableau
-- Example Output:
-- candidate_id
-- 123
-- Explanation
-- Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 
-- 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

SELECT candidate_id 
FROM candidates
where skill IN ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')
group by candidate_id 
having count(skill)=3
